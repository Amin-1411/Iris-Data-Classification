## Iris-Data Set
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. This dataset is very popular among Machinel Learning people and is specially recommended to the beginners to work with this dataset.
## Data Description and Use
The dataset consists of 150 samples and 4 different features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species. The data is used for classification purposes using different machine learning models. In our code we have used Logistic Regression to classify the data.
Note: One need not to download the dataset as it can be import directly using Machine Learning library in the code.
